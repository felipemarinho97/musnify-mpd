**Musnify** is a simple script written in python that provides notification support for [Music Player Daemon](https://github.com/MaxKellermann/MPD) using _libnotify_0.7_.
It can also display the album covers loaded from _last.fm_ in the notification status or (experimental) covers from the user music library.
